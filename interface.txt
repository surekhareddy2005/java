functional interfaces

1.an interface with only one abstract methos is called a functional interface . a functional interface can have any number of static or 
defalut methods
but one abstract method.
2.you can use annotation @FunctionalInterface on top any interface to ensure it won't contain more than one abstrace method.
3 functional interfaces are used to write lamba functions in java.
4.since functional interfaces will contain only 1 abstract method with exactly one signature there is a possibilty using them as
lambda functions.
